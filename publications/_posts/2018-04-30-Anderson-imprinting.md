Changes in gene expression can have profound effects on phenotype. Nature has provided 
many complex patterns of gene regulation such as imprinting. Imprinted genes exhibit 
differences in the expression of the maternal and paternal alleles, even though they reside 
in the same nucleus with access to the same trans-acting factors. Significant attention has 
been focused on the potential reasons that imprinted expression could be beneficial and 
stabilized by selection. However, less attention has focused on understanding how 
imprinted expression might arise or decay. We discuss the evidence for frequent turnover of 
imprinted expression based on evolutionary analyses in plants and the potential role for 
transposable elements (TEs) in creating imprinted expression patterns.
