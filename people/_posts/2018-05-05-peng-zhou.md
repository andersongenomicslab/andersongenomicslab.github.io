# Research Experiences
* Post Doctoral Associate, Dept. of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of Minnesota
  * Illucidate dynamic patterns of gene expression additivity and regulatory variation throughout maize development
  * Build gene regulatory networks across maize development to understand the genetic basis of heterosis
* Graduate Research Assistant, Dept. of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota
  * Developed a computational pipeline to scan and accurately annotate small defense-related peptides in plant genomes
  * Constructed *de novo* assemblies of 15 *Medicago* accessions and built a *Medicago* Pan-genome
  * Systematically characterized genome-wide architecture and patterns of structural variants of defense-related gene families in *Medicago* populations
