Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a significant portion of the Maize genome. I am interested in genomics and bioinformatics in specific transposons-Helitrons. Helitrons are the newest class of transposable elements discovered in 2001 by computational analysis. Helitrons have evolutionary significance in maize. My goal is to better understand the Helitrons for understanding the maize genes that are less likely to be functional.
