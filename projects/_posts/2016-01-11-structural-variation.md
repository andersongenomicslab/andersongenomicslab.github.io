Transposable elements constitute a large portion of crop genomes, and in maize, the majority of the genome is derived from LTR retrotransposons. These TEs are highly variable across genotypes and make up a large portion of genetic variability across lines. We employ computational tools to understand the dynamics and consequences of TE variability in maize.
