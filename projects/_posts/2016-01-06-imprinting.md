In maize, seed development initiates with double fertilization to form the embryo and the endosperm. In the endosperm, some genes exhibit parent-of-origin based, or imprinted, gene expression. We are interested in understanding how imprinting arises at a locus and how genetic and epigenetic differences work together to create an imprinted pattern of expression.
