The genome of many plant species is a mosaic of genes and repetitive elements.  Most of these repetitive elements are derived from different types of transposable elements (TEs).  The exact types and locations of transposons present in genomes varies widely between species and even between individuals of the same species.  Genomes have developed a variety of mechanisms to suppress transposon movement and to mitigate the influences of TEs on genes.  We study how different transposable elements contribute to the transcriptome, and how these contributions vary across development and genotypes.  In addition, we aim to understand how TEs are expressed and how transposons might create new regulatory information that can influence expression of genes.
