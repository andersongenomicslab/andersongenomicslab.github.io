The genome of many plant species is composed of genes interspersed in large regions of intergenic space containing large stretches of transposable elements (TEs). We study how different TEs contribute to the transcriptome, and how these contributions vary across development and genotypes. In addition, we aim to understand how TEs are expressed and how transposons might create new regulatory information that can influence expression of genes.
