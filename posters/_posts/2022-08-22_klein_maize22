Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a large portion of the maize genome and are a major contributor to genotypic variation. Novel insertions of transposable elements have been associated to significant phenotypic alterations and there is growing evidence supporting their role as potential regulators of transcriptional networks, particularly in response to abiotic stress. Recent work has identified several TEs and TE families containing promoters or enhancers rendering neighboring genes stress-responsive, making TEs a largely untapped potential for crop improvement via transcriptional rewiring. While responses to some abiotic stresses (cold, heat, drought) have already been observed, no research has yet explored TE responses to a mineral-based stress, like limited nitrogen (N) availability. Using the NAM founders, we are investigating potential associations between TEs and root growth angle, a root architectural trait that has been directly linked to improved N acquisition, under variable N availability. We planted the NAM founders in the field under high and low N and observed substantial variation in root system architecture and plant performance measures under N stress. We identified B73 as a steep-angled and non-responsive genotype whereas Oh7B was shallow-angled and N-responsive. In parallel, we are adapting a bioinformatic approach enabling us to quantify TE presence/absence variation in the NAM founders. Ultimately, we will integrate these phenomic and genomic efforts to associate TE insertional polymorphisms with root growth angle phenotypes, which will further our understanding of the role TEs play in mediating transcriptional and phenotypic responses to environmental stress.
