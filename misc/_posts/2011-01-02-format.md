The image should be a square image (300x300 or 400x400, etc.).  All member images and PDFs should be placed in [`images/people/`](https://github.com/andersongenomicslab/andersongenomicslab.github.io/tree/master/images/people) and [`pdfs/people/`](https://github.com/andersongenomicslab/andersongenomicslab.github.io/tree/master/pdfs/people) respectively.

After the topper matter, one can write more description content using the Markdown syntax. For more information check the [Markdown style guide](/misc/style).

## Papers

Each paper lives in [`publications/_posts/`](https://github.com/andersongenomicslab/andersongenomicslab.github.io/tree/master/publications/_posts).  File names, used to construct permalinks, are first author plus short (1-2 word) title, for example [`2009-11-20-B73-maize-genome.md`](https://github.com/andersongenomicslab/andersongenomicslab.github.io/blob/master/publications/_posts/2009-11-20-B73-maize-genome.md).   Papers have the following YAML metadata:

```
